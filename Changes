[Changes for 0.10 - 2007-12-29]

* Add support for %opts, an alias for named arguments in %{$_[1]}:

    package Foo;
    use selfvars;

        $self->{x} = $opts{x};
    }

    # Call it like this:
    $foo->meth({x => 4});

* Support for omitting the "undef" part in selective imports:

    # Import $self and %opts but not @args
    use selfvars -self, -opts;
